The implementation is based on an NMF class (@NMF) that includes all the relevant functions. The usage of this class is demonstrated in demo.m in which BNMF is used for supervised and unsupervised noise reduction proposed in. When you run demo in Matlab, make sure that the directory that includes @NMF is in the Matlab search path.
